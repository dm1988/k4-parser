# Codex Usage Rules

Follow these rules for every remaining task:
1. Work on one task at a time marked by ##.
2. Run only focused tests while implementing a task.
3. Run Pint after PHP files change.
4. Larastan once at the final integration checkpoint, not after every small edit.
5. Preserve unrelated working-tree changes.
6. Update TODO.md with outcomes instead of adding another plan or duplicate checklist.
7. Create a commit message for each task


## Dark mode

* Configure Tailwind CSS v3 with `darkMode: 'class'`.
* Define a three-state theme preference: `light`, `dark`, or `system`.
* Add an inline `<head>` initialization script to apply the saved preference before the page renders and prevent a flash of the wrong theme.
* Persist the preference in `localStorage`; when `system` is selected, respond to changes from `prefers-color-scheme`.
* Add an accessible theme control to the desktop and mobile navigation with clear labels, keyboard support, and the current state exposed to assistive technology.
* Apply the theme initialization and controls consistently to the authenticated and guest layouts.
* Add semantic light/dark styles to the shared component classes in `resources/css/app.css`, including cards, headers, buttons, badges, and file inputs.
* Add `dark:` variants throughout shared Blade components before updating individual pages, covering backgrounds, text, borders, shadows, form controls, validation states, dropdowns, modals, and focus rings.
* Update the dashboard, schedule extractor, flight-plan extractor, profile, and authentication pages to use the shared dark-mode patterns.
* Decide whether the already-dark welcome and privacy-policy pages should remain fixed-dark or honor the saved theme, then make their behavior consistent with that decision.
* Verify Filament's admin-panel theme setting separately so it follows the same default and does not conflict with the application preference.
* Add tests that assert the theme initializer and accessible control are rendered in both layouts.
* Manually verify light, dark, and system modes at mobile and desktop breakpoints, including refresh behavior and live operating-system theme changes.
* Run the focused PHPUnit tests and `vendor/bin/sail npm run build` to confirm the Blade and Tailwind changes compile successfully.

## Flight Plan extract request log to database

* Record the authenticated user, `source_type = pdf`, and `parser_type = flight_plan`.
* Create the row immediately before extraction with `status = partial`.
* Reuse the existing request logger to capture the UUID, file hash, file size, duration, and application/extractor versions.
* Mark the request `success` after extraction.
* Mark the request `failed` with `FlightRouteNotFoundException` or another exception type when extraction fails.
* Keep the current redirect, validation message, temporary-file deletion, and application logging behavior unchanged.
* Add `Flight Plan` to the parser filter in the Filament Extract Requests table.
* Generalize the schedule-specific logger into an `ExtractRequestLogger` with a completion method that accepts explicit counts.
* For a successful flight-plan extraction, record:
  * `detected_event_count = 1`
  * `detected_flight_count = 1`
  * `detected_hotel_count = 0`
  * `page_count = null`, unless PDF page counting is added
* Add tests covering successful extraction, recognized extraction failure, unexpected exceptions, file cleanup, correct user/hash/size metadata, and confirmation that invalid uploads do not create rows.
