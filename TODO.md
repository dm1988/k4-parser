# Flight Plan Brief Roadmap

Build one reviewable flight-release workspace from the normalized extraction pipeline. Parse each source fact once, keep operational values typed, and present unavailable data honestly instead of inferring it.

### Product and UI rules

- Use Aviation Blue for structure, Compass Gold for primary emphasis, and the existing light/dark theme tokens.
- Keep operational values compact and scannable; use monospaced text for codes, times, routes, coordinates, and numeric planning values.
- Label every time basis and fuel unit. Never silently mix UTC/local or pounds/kilograms.
- Distinguish `not present in this release` from `not supported yet`. Do not render zero, empty text, or a green status for missing data.
- Preserve source evidence internally for Weather, ETOPS, Fuel Score, and Weight & Balance.
- Reuse Blade components and view data; do not parse, normalize, query, or authorize inside Blade.
- Every interactive control needs keyboard access, visible focus, an accessible name, and a useful loading/empty/error state.

# Tasks

## Refactor overview task
- Emphsize attention items
- Remove duplicate data that exists in flight strip header
- Show MELs/CDLs if they exist
- Show ETOPS info if it exists

## Crew list: role avatar
- Have crew role displayed inside an avatar bubble
Entry: Crew Card UI Refactor
Goal Improve the visual hierarchy and scannability of the crew roster by moving the "Crew Role" (e.g., PIC, SIC, MX) from a secondary text line into a prominent "Avatar Bubble" anchor. The design must be professional, differentiate roles at a glance, and maintain high readability in both light and dark modes without being visually overwhelming.

Current Setup

Container: ul grid using grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 for responsive layout.
Card Structure:
Horizontal flex layout (flex items-center gap-3).
Backgrounds: bg-white (light) / bg-slate-900 (dark).
Borders: Subtle navy tint border-[#1B365D]/10.
Avatar Bubble: A 12x10 (48px wide) flex container with a uniform background (bg-[#1B365D]/5) and role-specific text coloring.
Details: A vertical stack containing the Name (bold) and Employee Number (monospace, prefixed with #).
Implementation Details

Layout Logic:
Switched from flex-col to flex-row (using items-center) to place the role avatar as a visual "bullet" on the left.
Role-Based Semantic Styling:
Unified Background: All bubbles use bg-[#1B365D]/5 to maintain page consistency.
Text Color Palette:
PIC: text-blue-600
SIC/FO: text-indigo-600
MX: text-amber-600
LM: text-emerald-600
Others: text-slate-600
Typography:
Role: text-[10px] font-black uppercase tracking-wider for a "badge" aesthetic.
Employee ID: Simplified to a small secondary row (text-[10px]) to reduce vertical height.
Dark Mode Support: All colors include dark: variants (e.g., dark:bg-slate-800 for the bubble and dark:text-blue-400 for role text) to ensure WCAG contrast compliance.

## Add task: Takeoff and Landing Report

Naming outcome: Renamed the view-model presentation API from the ambiguous `envelope*` prefix to `tlr*`. The normalized payload continues using its existing `envelope` storage key until the broader data contract is migrated.

Commit message: `refactor: rename envelope view model methods to tlr`

Source remarks

**Warnings**
No supported source warnings were listed with the selected result.

No independent performance determination

This view repeats the confirmed source result. It does not calculate an envelope or label the condition safe; review the controlling performance report.

## Triple extract key flight release data
- Key flight plan data is found on the 3 copies. Ensure regex matches 3 times for data found on the top copy.
- If not found 3 times, reduce confidence score yet still present data
- Show user message to check the value

## Create a way to turn tasks on or off
- in ENV and config files
- in coordination with enum

## Refactor FlightPlanBriefTest
- Split tests and organize into folders grouped by test focus area

## PEST architechure tests
- Does pest need to be installed? 
- Can I run along side existing test suite?
- Naming
- Layering

## Aircraft lookup and display weights
- Lookup aircraft by tail_number in db
- Expose weights to user
- Compare planned weights to aircraft weight limits

## 17. Reserve fuel
- Create distinction between Alternate airport burn and Reserve fuel calculation. 
- Differed due to needing aircraft type fixture and distintion between 747 and 777 aircraft type
- Requires full fleet in production database.
- coincides with future 747 seeder into production
- will have to add migration for reserve fuel additive

# Smart maintenance counter badges
- If MELs exist render in warning
- If no MELs but CDLs present, render caution
- If no MEL and CDLs but NEF or COI carry over, render Neutral
- No maintenance items, render success
