## 4. Streamline the Upload Card Structure
- The file upload input and the "Parse" button feel somewhat detached because they are aligned horizontally with wide gaps.

- Fix: Consider stacking the input elements or tightening the container width. 

- Alternatively, transform the upload zone into a larger, centered drag-and-drop target box with an icon, placing a full-width or cleanly aligned "Parse" button directly beneath it.

## 5. Refine Card Hierarchy and Margins
 - The main blue header card ("Flight Deck") and the white upload card are stacked close together with identical widths, creating a rigid block appearance.

 - Fix: Nest the file upload and filters section inside a single, unified container card, where the dark blue header serves as the hero header of that card. This removes the double-card stacking look and groups the context ("what this tool does") directly with the action ("upload your file").

- Spacing: Increase the vertical spacing (gap or margin-bottom) between the hero header card and the upload card if you keep them separate.

## 6. Improve Grid/Flex Alignment
- Filters Section: The "Filters" label and the "Show options" dropdown toggle are pushed to the extreme edges of the container. If a user expands "Show options," the checkboxes will likely appear far away from the initial visual anchor. Aligning these elements or placing the filter options directly in a collapsible accordion that spans a more readable, centered width would feel more cohesive.

- Alignment: Ensure the text inside the "Choose File" button box vertically aligns perfectly with the text baseline of the "Parse" button.

## 7. Navbar Typography
- The navbar items ("Parse Schedule", "Route Extractor", etc.) are quite close to the top edge of the viewport. Adding a bit more top and bottom padding to the navbar container will give the text room to breathe and look cleaner.

## 8. Install laravel debug bar

## Prep for rename

- Decide how to hanlde to prefered extract verbage

## 10. Use a descriptive footer disclaimer in Parse schedule tool:
- To safely clarify your tool's relationship to the platform, add a small, subtle line of text at the very bottom of your application page layout:

Disclaimer: This tool is an independent utility built for crew convenience and is not affiliated with, authorized, or endorsed by Jeppesen or Boeing.

## 11. One line status message? Can leave as title, sub title message
